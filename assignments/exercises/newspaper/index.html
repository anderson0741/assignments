    <p class="column one">Its been a long kept secret that tables have a color.  But this local Miami individual <em>[Paul]</em> recently noticed something funny, 
        "the table, I noticed it, its brown!" Authorities are still investigating the cause for the color in the table, as of right 
        now they are saying it could be caused from the trees they were cut down from.</p>
    <p class="column two">The discovery of the tables color has people up in arms, saying his table is yellow, and that <strong>"Paul is wrong!"</strong> This has already gone viral 
        with thousands of people offended by this recent discovery. Seventy six people have already been arrested due to violent protests that have
        broken out.  Crime is at an all time high as a result in many small towns accross the US.
