                <h2>Our Perfect Dream World..........</h2>
                <p>My “utopia”, my perfect place, my “dream world” would be something not too way over the top like flying spaceships,
                    or robots bringing me drinks. It would be a very quiet, calm, and peaceful place where I can actually
                    hear my thoughts, and individuals are all treated fairly, and everyone isn’t afraid of sharing their
                    opinions about life or society without getting bad looks from others. I’m not saying I’d be living in
                    a cube or anything like that. Of course the water would be always deep blue, the weather would be not
                    too hot but occasionally cool, the skies would always have puffy clouds and bright blue skies, and the
                    stars would shine the most brightest at night. My “utopia” would be a place where it would be safe to
                    walk outside in the middle of the night without having to think about something dangerous happening to
                    you. A place where you can go to a park and hang out for several hours without having to think about
                    a hundred different things that run through your head constantly.</p>

                    <strong>*Lucid Dreams*</strong> are very common following a traumatic event. Whether they picture the traumatic
                    event directly, or involve other images and themes, or both, they probably reflect a normal healing process,
                    and will diminish in frequency and intensity if recovery is progressing. If after several weeks no change
                    is noted, consultation with a therapist is advisable.What a wonderful day it is today tra la la. I need
                    to make this paragraph to be the length of the picture on it's left. Perhaps it will make it a lot easier
                    on the eyes and not as blocky. Hopefully it is alright that I am just typing in random nonsense to fill
                    in the blanks. Almost there and then we can get back to dreaming all day long. Every day all day. I am
                    ready to take a nice lonnng nap so I can dream.</p>
                <h2 class="dumb">*Dream Catchers*</h2>
                <img class="dcmain" src="d1.jpg" alt="" />
                <p>dream·catch·er ˈdrēmˌkaCHər,ˈdrēmˌkeCHər/Submit noun noun: dream-catcher a small hoop containing a horsehair
                    mesh, or a similar construction of string or yarn, decorated with feathers and beads, believed to give
                    its owner good dreams. Dreamcatchers were originally made by American Indians.
